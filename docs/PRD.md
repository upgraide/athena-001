## Data Flow

```
User Input → NLP Processing → Intent Classification → Agent Router
    ↓
Relevant Agent(s) → Action Execution → Data Storage
    ↓
Cross-Agent Sync → User Notification → Feedback Loop
```

## Cross-Agent Intelligence

**Critical Integration Points:**

1. **Finance + Calendar**: Every meeting tagged with cost, travel expenses auto-captured
2. **Email + Task**: Every commitment in email becomes a tracked task
3. **Calendar + Task**: Tasks automatically get time blocks, meetings generate follow-up tasks
4. **Research + Notes**: Research findings auto-organize into knowledge base
5. **Food + Finance**: Meal plans optimize for budget, grocery spending tracked
6. **All Agents → Notes**: Everything learned gets stored for future reference

**Shared Context:**

- Unified user profile accessible by all agents
- Event bus for real-time agent communication
- Shared memory for cross-agent learning
- Priority system prevents conflicts between agents

## Key Decisions Made

1. **AI-First:** Every feature uses AI for intelligence, not just automation
2. **Privacy:** Local processing option for sensitive data
3. **Unified Experience:** One interface, multiple agents
4. **Progressive Automation:** Start with assistance, graduate to full automation
5. **Open Ecosystem:** API-first for third-party integrations

## What Success Looks Like

After 30 days, a user should:

- Never manually categorize an expense or retrieve an invoice
- Never miss a bill, appointment, or important relationship event
- Have all emails organized with inbox zero maintained
- Complete 90% of tasks on time with smart delegation
- Save 2+ hours daily on administrative tasks
- Access any piece of information in <3 seconds
- Trust the system to handle routine decisions
- Feel like they have a team of assistants

## Non-Goals

- Not a general purpose AI assistant (like ChatGPT)
- Not trying to replace human judgment on complex decisions
- Not building our own LLM
- Not competing with existing calendar/email/task apps - we integrate
- Not social media management
- Not work-specific tools (code, design, etc)

## Development Priorities

1. **Accuracy over features** - Each agent must work reliably before adding more
2. **Speed is critical** - User won't wait more than 2 seconds
3. **Privacy by design** - User owns their data, always
4. **Mobile-first** - Most interactions will be on mobile
5. **Fail gracefully** - When AI fails, have sensible fallbacks

## Ship Timeline

- Week 4: Internal MVP
- Week 8: Private beta (100 users)
- Week 12: Public beta (1,000 users)
- Week 16: General availability

## Pricing Model

- **Individual**: $29/month (save 2+ hours/day)
- **Power User**: $49/month (advanced AI features, unlimited storage)
- **Family**: $79/month (up to 5 members)
- **Business**: $75/user/month (team features, admin controls)
